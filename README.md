## How to Use

the image files path is in the csv files,and put the image on the path,use the vnet_train_predict.py file train the model. 

training the model on the GTX1080,it take 20 hours,and i also attach the trained model in the project,you also just use the vnet_train_predict.py file to predict,and get the segmentation result.
